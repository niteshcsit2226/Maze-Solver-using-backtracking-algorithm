# Maze-Solver-using-backtracking-algorithm
The program attempts to solve a maze represented as a 2D array of characters. The goal is to find a path from a starting point to an exit point (denoted as 'X'). If a valid path exists, the program marks it. The approach used to solve the maze is backtracking.
